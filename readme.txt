Re-order or disable the homepage components in certain themes.

== Description ==

Using Homepage Control, any theme which uses a "homepage" (or other) hook to display components on a homepage, just got better. Re-order or disable any of the homepage components added by your theme, and control the display and order of any function hooked on to the "homepage" hook.

Looking for a helping hand? [View plugin documentation](https://docs.woocommerce.com/document/homepage-control/).

== Usage ==

Once activated, a "Homepage Control" item will display in the Theme Customizer ( Appearance > Customizer ).

Visiting this screen will display a table of the possible homepage components, with options for re-ordering them, or disabling individual components.

Once done, click the "Save Changes" button, to commit your new component order into the system.

== Installation ==

Installing "Homepage Control" can be done either by searching for "Homepage Control" via the "Plugins > Add New" screen in your WordPress dashboard, or by using the following steps:

1. Download the plugin via WordPress.org.
1. Upload the ZIP file through the "Plugins > Add New > Upload" screen in your WordPress dashboard.
1. Activate the plugin
1. Visit the "Appearance > Customizer" section, select "Homepage Control". There you can select the components you'd like to display, and in which order.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= No components show up in the administration area. Is my theme broken? =

Not at all. This simply means your theme doesn't support the "homepage" action hook, which is a method of adding components to a homepage design.

Please consult your theme developer if you have further queries about customising your homepage.

= What happens if I switch themes? Do I lose my settings? =

Not at all. :) If you switch themes, Homepage Control will remember the homepage component settings for each theme you apply changes to, making switching themes a breeze.

= How do I contribute? =
